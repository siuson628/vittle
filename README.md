[Vite: 12 Features that Make it a Production Worthy & All-Rounder Build Tool](https://www.derpycoder.com/vite-12-features-that-make-it-a-production-worthy-all-rounder-build-tool/)

## Features
- [x] Svelte
- [x] Vite
- [x] Prettier
- [x] ESLint
- [x] Aliasing
- [x] Netlify SPA
- [x] Tailwind JIT
- [x] Routify

## How to Run?
### For Dev
- `npm run routify`
- `npm run dev`

### For Prod
- `npm run build`
- `npm run serve`

### For ESLint
- `npm run fix`

### For Formatting with Prettier
- `npm run format`

## Why?
- This is a starter I want to use to replace the defacto Rollup starter provided by Svelte, which is verbose and slow as hell for development purposes. See [Quiller Bee Repo](https://github.com/quillerbee/job-portal)
- Svelte Kit is not yet ready.
- Using Sapper is like going backwords. (Even though Svelte Kit is going to have migration guide for Sapper users.)
